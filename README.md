Simple Logger using sensor DS18B20 and a Raspberry py

In this project a Raspberry pi is used to measure room temperature and store the value on a Google spreadsheet.

The code for getting the temperature handling the sensor DS18B20 is taken [here](http://www.circuitbasics.com/raspberry-pi-ds18b20-temperature-sensor-tutorial/).
